Activity done in this projects:-
Data Preprocessing:
Handling Missing Data: Fill or remove missing values.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert non-numerical data (e.g., age group, race) into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Scaling Numerical Features: Standardize features to ensure they have similar scales.

Model Training:
Use logistic regression models to predict the probabilities of receiving each vaccine. Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems.
Train separate models for each vaccine (xyz and seasonal).

Model Evaluation:
Use the ROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve) score to evaluate how well the models distinguish between individuals who received the vaccines and those who did not. A score closer to 1 indicates a better model.
Prediction:

Predict the probabilities of each individual receiving the vaccines.
Generate a submission file containing these probabilities for further analysis or competition submission.

Results Achieved:-
The models achieved the following ROC AUC scores:
xyz_vaccine: 0.822
seasonal_vaccine: 0.847
These scores suggest that the models perform well in predicting vaccine uptake.

Conclusion
By using logistic regression and carefully preprocessing the data, we were able to build models that accurately predict the likelihood of individuals receiving the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines. This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques in public health to understand and predict vaccination behaviors.
